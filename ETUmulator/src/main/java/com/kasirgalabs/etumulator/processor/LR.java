 * subroutine return address. To perform a subroutine return, copy LR back to the program counter.
 * This is done in the following way, after entering the subroutine with a BL instruction:<br>
 * On subroutine entry, store LR to the stack with an instruction of the form: PUSH {LR} and use
 * a matching instruction to return: POP {PC}
 * <p>
 * This class represents an observable object. After a state change on LR value, all of it's
 * observers will be notified through default {@link BaseDispatcher} or the Dispatcher initialized
